## Question 1: Think before you code

I would first look the design and identify where I can use grid layout or flexbox.
In this case I would divide the left and the right portion. The left being the most 
viewed contents and the right are the least. Then on the left I would make a blog 
component that lists blog contents and identifies the type of blog content (Article, Video, and etc). 
Then the layout of the post would be grid and be divided into two, the left being 
the photo,and the right will be the information like title, content type, and description. 
Then I would set rules which if a title and description goes past beyond a certain number of characters it would append ellipses (...). 
My questions would be, if viewed in smaller devices. Can the blog posts on the right panel be
same size with the contents on the left?
