## Question 3: Share a story
Last year was really a bad year. Our university had to stop physical classes and 
take them virtually instead. During those virtual classes, I started to feel that what 
the school is teaching isn't really enough. So then, I enrolled to an online course and never
stopped coding since then. After I took one course I started to build my portfolio website and 
I noticed a repetiveness. I researched and I found ReactJS, and it was really fascinating because
of the concept where you can build elements and never build them again. So I started using ReactJS
and the my codes look so much cleaner and there is not much spaghetti code
